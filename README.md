There seem to be a reasonable number of people around looking for a maximum weight bipartite matching algorithm for boost. It isn't the nicest code I've written (it was written rather a while ago). but it works. Let me know if you have any improvements/issues etc. All my graphs use int vertex_descriptors so I can simply use the pairs of int returned as pairs of vertex_descriptors. If someone knows a way of mapping back that is zero cost when the vertex descriptors are a int, please let me know. Enjoy.
